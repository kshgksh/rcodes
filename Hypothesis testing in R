#Q1.	Anand, the cofounder of JAT, claims that disease 6 (leaf curl) information was accessed
#at least 60 times every month on average since October 2017 due to this disease outbreak. 
#Test this claim at a significance level of 0.05 using an appropriate hypothesis test

#H0 : mu <= 60
# Ha : mu > 60
jdata1 <- subset(jdata,jdata$`Month-Year`>= "2017-10-01")
t.test(jdata1$D6, mu=60, alternative = "greater", conf.level = 0.95)

#conclusion:- 
#Since the pvalue(0.013)after the one sample t-test is less than alpha(0.05), we reject the null hypothesis
#and the alternative hypothesis is statistically significant.hence the claim that the disease 6 information was 
#accessed at least 60 times every month on an average since october 2017 is true.

#Q2-	Among the app users for disease information,
#at least 15% of them access disease information related to disease 6.
#Use an appropriate hypothesis test to check this claim at a = 0.05.

#Ha: p > 0.15 where, p = proportion of users accessing information on Disease 6.

#conclusion:- 
#Since the pvalue for the single sample proportion test is 0.99 , which is greater than alpha(0.05), we can not
#reject the Null, Ho. The test is statistically insignificant. Hence the claim that,among the app users for disease

#conclusion:- the p value(1) in the two sample t-test is greater than alpha (0.05).Hence we go with the

##Q.5 A new version of the app was released in August 2016. Anand wants to understand which month in the given

#conclusion :-
#since the pvalue(0.000000)is less than alpha(0.05),we reject the null hyothesis.
#The test is statistically significant. The claim that the mean usage pattern shows a statistical significance
